# Project Name

**Author**: Adam Jimenez
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

For this assignment, I am creating an app that handles the geo location whenever the user inputs a city name that will direct them to that particular part of the map in the world. It will also feature the weather that will be incorporated into the app.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
First thing first is to create a new repository in Github and then go to the local machine to install npm in which deals with the node modules once after they have created the vite and the cloned new repository from Github. I would then need to create a  branch to work off of within the VS Code and create or update the files needed for a full functionality of the app.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

I am using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, API Keys, Github, Trello, VS Code, Netlify, Chat GPT, and the Terminal.

## Change Log

4-1-2024 Yesterday through today: had issues with the functionality of my App Deployment.

4-7-2024 Finally got the movies to display on locahost and realized it was a simple fix after TA Brandon and Tammy got me back on track along with John.

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

The following people helped me to get back on track: John, Brandon, and definitely Tammy! Thank you and as well as classmates.
